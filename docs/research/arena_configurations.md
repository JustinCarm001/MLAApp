# Arena Configurations for Hockey Live App

## Overview
This document details the arena configuration system that automatically determines optimal camera positions for different hockey rink types. The system removes the burden of positioning decisions from parents and ensures consistent, high-quality coverage.

## Arena Types and Specifications

### Standard North American Rink
```
Dimensions: 200' x 85'
Goal Line Distance: 11' from end boards
Face-off Circles: 30' diameter
Neutral Zone: 50' wide
```

**Optimal Camera Positions:**
1. **Goal Line 1** (Priority 1): Behind goal, centered
2. **Goal Line 2** (Priority 1): Behind opposite goal, centered
3. **Center Ice** (Priority 2): Elevated center position
4. **Bench Side** (Priority 3): Opposite player benches
5. **Corner Camera 1** (Priority 4): Corner coverage
6. **Corner Camera 2** (Priority 4): Opposite corner coverage

### Olympic/International Rink
```
Dimensions: 197' x 98.4'
Goal Line Distance: 13' from end boards
Face-off Circles: 30' diameter
Neutral Zone: 50' wide
```

**Camera Position Adjustments:**
- Wider rink requires adjusted corner positions
- Center ice camera covers more area
- Bench side positioning accounts for wider ice

### Junior/Youth Rink
```
Dimensions: 185' x 85'
Goal Line Distance: 10' from end boards
Face-off Circles: 28' diameter
Neutral Zone: 45' wide
```

**Camera Position Adjustments:**
- Closer positioning for smaller rink
- Adjusted center ice coverage
- Modified corner angles for optimal coverage

## Camera Positioning Algorithm

### Position Assignment Logic
```javascript
FUNCTION assignOptimalPositions(arenaType, numCameras):
    // Load arena configuration
    config = ARENA_CONFIGURATIONS[arenaType]
    
    // Sort positions by priority (goal lines first)
    sortedPositions = sortByPriority(config.optimal_positions)
    
    // Assign positions to available cameras
    assignments = []
    FOR i = 0 to numCameras - 1:
        position = sortedPositions[i]
        assignment = {
            camera_id: i,
            position: position,
            coordinates: calculateCoordinates(position, config),
            instructions: generateInstructions(position),
            coverage_area: calculateCoverageArea(position, config)
        }
        assignments.push(assignment)
    
    RETURN assignments
```

### Coverage Optimization
```javascript
FUNCTION optimizeCoverage(assignments, arenaConfig):
    // Calculate total ice coverage
    totalCoverage = 0
    coverageMap = initializeCoverageMap(arenaConfig)
    
    FOR each assignment in assignments:
        coverage = calculatePositionCoverage(assignment.position, arenaConfig)
        totalCoverage += coverage.area
        updateCoverageMap(coverageMap, coverage)
    
    // Identify gaps and suggest adjustments
    gaps = findCoverageGaps(coverageMap)
    suggestions = generatePositionSuggestions(gaps)
    
    RETURN {
        coverage_percentage: totalCoverage,
        gap_analysis: gaps,
        suggestions: suggestions
    }
```

            alternativePosition = findAlternativePosition(position, obstruction)
            adjustedInstructions = updateInstructions(position, alternativePosition)
            
    RETURN adjustedConfiguration
```

## Real-time Position Validation

### Setup Validation
```javascript

    detectedPosition = analyzePosition(cameraFeed)
    
    validation = {
        position_accuracy: comparePositions(detectedPosition, expectedPosition),
        angle_correct: validateAngle(cameraFeed, expectedPosition.angle),
        coverage_quality: assessCoverage(cameraFeed, expectedPosition.coverage_area),
        stability_check: checkStability(cameraFeed)
    }
    
    IF validation.position_accuracy < 0.8:
        corrections = generateCorrections(validation)
        RETURN { valid: false, corrections: corrections }
    
    RETURN { valid: true, setup_quality: validation }

    currentSetup = analyzeCameraSetup(cameraFeed)
    optimalSetup = getOptimalSetup(position)
    
    adjustments = []
    
    IF currentSetup.angle differs from optimalSetup.angle:
        adjustments.push({
            type: "angle_adjustment",
            current: currentSetup.angle,
            recommended: optimalSetup.angle,
            instructions: generateAngleInstructions(optimalSetup.angle)
        })
    
    IF currentSetup.zoom differs from optimalSetup.zoom:
        adjustments.push({
            type: "zoom_adjustment",
            current: currentSetup.zoom,
            recommended: optimalSetup.zoom,
            instructions: generateZoomInstructions(optimalSetup.zoom)
        })
    
    RETURN adjustments
```

## Coverage Analysis and Reporting

### Coverage Metrics
```javascript

    report = {
        total_coverage_percentage: 0,
        critical_area_coverage: {},
        redundancy_analysis: {},
        gap_identification: [],
        quality_score: 0
    }
    
    // Calculate coverage for each ice zone
    zones = ['defensive_zone_1', 'neutral_zone', 'defensive_zone_2']
    
    FOR each zone in zones:
        coverage = calculateZoneCoverage(assignments, zone, arenaConfig)
        report.critical_area_coverage[zone] = coverage
        report.total_coverage_percentage += coverage.percentage
    
    // Analyze redundancy (multiple cameras covering same area)
    report.redundancy_analysis = analyzeRedundancy(assignments)
    
    // Identify gaps in coverage
    report.gap_identification = identifyGaps(assignments, arenaConfig)
    
    // Calculate overall quality score
    report.quality_score = calculateQualityScore(report)
    
    RETURN report
```

### Optimization Suggestions
```javascript
FUNCTION generateOptimizationSuggestions(coverageReport, availableCameras):
    suggestions = []
    
    // Suggest position improvements
    IF coverageReport.total_coverage_percentage < 0.85:
        suggestions.push({
            type: "coverage_improvement",
            message: "Consider adding center ice camera for better coverage",
            impact: "high",
            implementation: "easy"
        })
    
    // Suggest redundancy reduction
    IF coverageReport.redundancy_analysis.high_overlap > 0.3:
        suggestions.push({
            type: "redundancy_reduction",
            message: "Adjust corner cameras to reduce overlap",
            impact: "medium",
            implementation: "medium"
        })
    
    // Suggest gap filling
    FOR each gap in coverageReport.gap_identification:
        IF gap.severity > 0.7:
            suggestions.push({
                type: "gap_filling",
                message: `Add camera at ${gap.recommended_position}`,
                impact: "high",
                implementation: "easy"
            })
