# Meta SAM 2 Integration for Hockey Live App

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of Meta's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for real-time player tracking and overlay features in the Hockey Live App.

## SAM 2 Capabilities for Hockey

### Core Features
- **Real-time Video Segmentation**: Process video at 44 FPS
- **Object Tracking**: Maintain player identity across frames
- **Occlusion Handling**: Track players even when blocked by others
- **Memory Attention**: Remember player appearances despite changes

### Hockey-Specific Applications
1. **Player Identification**: Segment and track individual players
2. **Jersey Number Recognition**: Overlay player numbers and names
3. **Puck Tracking**: Real-time puck location and movement
4. **Position Analysis**: Track player positions and formations
5. **Event Detection**: Identify key game events (shots, passes, checks)

## Technical Implementation

### SAM 2 Model Architecture
```
SAM 2 Pipeline:
  Input: Video frames (1080p @ 60fps)
  Processing: Real-time segmentation with memory attention
  Output: Segmented objects with tracking IDs
  Performance: 44 FPS processing capability
```

### Integration Pseudocode

#### Player Tracking System
```javascript
FUNCTION initializeSAM2PlayerTracking():
    LOAD SAM 2 model with hockey-specific training
    INITIALIZE player tracking database
    SET up memory attention for player identification
    CONFIGURE jersey number recognition
    RETURN tracking system ready
```

#### Real-time Player Overlay
```javascript
FUNCTION processFrameWithSAM2(videoFrame):
    // Segment all objects in frame
    segmentedObjects = SAM2.segment(videoFrame)
    
    // Filter for hockey players
    players = filterHockeyPlayers(segmentedObjects)
    
    // Track player movement
    FOR each player in players:
        playerID = maintainPlayerIdentity(player)
        jerseyNumber = recognizeJerseyNumber(player)
        position = calculatePlayerPosition(player)
        
        // Create overlay
        overlay = createPlayerOverlay(playerID, jerseyNumber, position)
        videoFrame = addOverlayToFrame(videoFrame, overlay)
    
    RETURN enhanced videoFrame
```

#### Puck Tracking
```javascript
FUNCTION trackPuckWithSAM2(videoFrame):
    // Segment puck object
    puckSegment = SAM2.segmentPuck(videoFrame)
    
    IF puckSegment found:
        puckPosition = calculatePuckPosition(puckSegment)
        puckVelocity = calculatePuckVelocity(puckPosition, previousPosition)
        
        // Add puck tracking overlay
        overlay = createPuckOverlay(puckPosition, puckVelocity)
        videoFrame = addOverlayToFrame(videoFrame, overlay)
    
    RETURN videoFrame with puck tracking
```

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan

## Technical Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- **GPU**: NVIDIA RTX 3060 or higher for real-time processing
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB recommended
- **Storage**: SSD for model and cache storage
- **Network**: High-speed internet for model downloads and updates

### Software Dependencies
```json

### Model Configuration
```python
# SAM 2 Configuration for Hockey
SAM2_CONFIG = {
    "model_type": "vit_h",
    "checkpoint": "sam2_hiera_large.pt",
    "device": "cuda",
    "points_per_side": 64,
    "pred_iou_thresh": 0.88,

    "crop_n_points_downscale_factor": 2,
    "min_mask_region_area": 100
}
```

## Performance Optimization

### Real-time Processing Strategies
1. **Frame Skipping**: Process every 2nd frame for 30fps effective rate
2. **Region of Interest**: Focus processing on active play areas
3. **Multi-threading**: Parallel processing for multiple cameras
4. **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage for tracking history

### Quality vs Performance Trade-offs
- **High Quality**: Full resolution, all features, 30fps
- **Balanced**: 720p resolution, core features, 60fps
- **Performance**: 480p resolution, basic tracking, 120fps

## Data Flow Architecture

### Input Processing
```
Multi-camera Feeds → Frame Synchronization → SAM 2 Processing → Overlay Generation → Stream Output
```

### Memory Management
```
Player Tracking Database:
  - Player IDs and jersey numbers
  - Historical positions and movements
  - Appearance templates for re-identification
  - Game statistics and events
```

## Error Handling

### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Player Occlusion**: Use memory attention to maintain tracking
2. **Lighting Changes**: Adaptive threshold adjustment
3. **Fast Movement**: Increase processing frame rate
4. **Multiple Similar Players**: Enhanced jersey number recognition

### Fallback Strategies
- **SAM 2 Failure**: Switch to basic object detection
- **GPU Overload**: Reduce processing resolution
- **Network Issues**: Cache previous player identities

## Future Enhancements

### Advanced Features (Phase 3+)
1. **Player Statistics**: Automated shot tracking and analysis
2. **Tactical Analysis**: Formation recognition and play patterns
3. **Automated Highlights**: Key moment detection and compilation
4. **Multi-angle Integration**: Combine tracking from multiple cameras

### AI Model Integration
- **Custom Hockey Training**: Fine-tune SAM 2 for hockey-specific scenarios
- **Jersey Recognition**: Specialized model for number/name detection
- **Event Classification**: AI model for play recognition

## Cost Considerations

### Processing Costs
- **Cloud Processing**: $0.05-0.10 per minute of video
- **Local Processing**: One-time hardware investment
- **Hybrid Approach**: Local for real-time, cloud for advanced features

### Licensing
- **SAM 2 License**: Apache 2.0 (free for commercial use)
- **Additional Models**: Varies by provider
- **Training Data**: May require licensing for professional datasets
