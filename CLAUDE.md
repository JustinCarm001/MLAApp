# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Hockey Live App (MLAApp) is an AI-powered multi-camera hockey game streaming platform that transforms parent smartphone recordings into professional-quality game videos. The app targets U16-U18 hockey leagues, allowing parents to use their phones as cameras to create professional game coverage with future AI commentary.

**Technology Stack:**
- **Mobile**: React Native (iOS/Android cross-platform)
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI with PostgreSQL
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (S3, ECS), Docker, Redis
- **Video Processing**: Real-time multi-camera stitching with quality assessment

## Architecture Overview

### Mobile App Architecture

The React Native app follows a component-based architecture:

**Hockey Live Mobile (Expo):**
- `src/screens/` - Main UI screens (auth, teams, home, profile)
- `src/components/` - Reusable UI components
- `src/navigation/` - Navigation setup and routing
- `src/services/` - API communication (api.js, gameSync.js)
- `src/context/` - React Context providers (AuthContext, TeamContext)
- `src/config/` - Configuration files (API endpoints, arena positioning)

**Alternative Mobile Setup:**
- `src/Screens/` - Organized by feature (auth, main, data)
- `src/components/` - Categorized components (basic, cards, forms, lists, navigation)
- `src/services/` - Business logic (api.js, authServices.js, gameSync.js)
- `src/config/` - JSON configuration files and constants
- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers

### Backend Architecture

FastAPI backend with layered architecture:
- **API Layer** (`app/api/v1/`): REST endpoints for auth, games, teams, streaming
- **Core Layer** (`app/core/`): Configuration, database, security, exceptions
- **Models Layer** (`app/models/`): SQLAlchemy database models
- **Schema Layer** (`app/schemas/`): Pydantic validation schemas
- **Service Layer** (`app/services/`): Business logic (future implementation)

### Database Design

PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM:
- User authentication and profiles
- Team management and memberships
- Game sessions and coordination
- Video processing and storage metadata

## Core Game Flow

1. **Game Creation**: Coach/organizer creates session, generates 6-digit join code
2. **Parent Joining**: Parents scan QR code or enter game code, select team context
3. **Position Assignment**: Flexible camera positioning with quality-based priorities
4. **Recording**: Synchronized multi-camera recording with real-time streaming
5. **Processing**: Cloud-based video stitching and quality enhancement

## Configuration Files

### Arena Positioning System
- `hockey-live-mobile/src/config/arena_positioning.js`
- `mobile/ios/src/config/arena_positioning.js`

Contains NHL research-informed camera position priorities:
- Center Ice Elevated: Priority 1 (1.0 weight)
- Corner Diagonal: Priority 2 (0.85 weight)
- Bench Side: Priority 3 (0.75 weight)
- Goal Line: Priority 4 (0.65 weight)

### API Configuration
- `hockey-live-mobile/src/config/api_endpoints.js`
- `mobile/ios/src/config/api_endpoints.json`

Defines all backend endpoints for games, streaming, user management, and arena configuration.

## Testing Strategy

### Backend Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=app tests/

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_auth.py::test_user_login

# Generate HTML coverage report
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html tests/
```

### Mobile Testing
```bash
# Run tests (mobile/ios)
npm test

# Run with coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Run specific test
npm test -- --testNamePattern="Auth"
```

## Development Environment

### Required Services
- **PostgreSQL**: Primary database (port 5432)
- **Redis**: Caching and session storage (port 6379)
- **FastAPI**: Backend API server (port 8000)
- **React Native Metro**: Mobile development server (port 8081)

### Environment Variables
Key environment variables for development:
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `REDIS_URL`: Redis connection string
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: JWT token signing key
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: AWS credentials (for video storage)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode

## Phase Development

**Phase 1 (Current)**: Multi-camera coordination with automated positioning
- Flexible camera assignment based on NHL broadcast standards
- Quality assessment system for intelligent camera weighting
- Parent-friendly UX with team management

**Phase 2**: AI enhancement with Meta SAM 2 integration for player tracking
**Phase 3**: Automated AI commentary generation
**Phase 4**: Complete AI broadcasting with analytics

## Important Notes

### Camera Quality System
The system uses multi-dimensional quality assessment (technical, positional, stability, content) to weight camera contributions. Poor quality cameras receive minimal screen time while high-quality cameras get priority in the final edit.

### Real-time Processing
Target <200ms processing latency per frame pair for smooth 30fps output using cloud-based multi-GPU processing following NHL's AWS-based approach.

### Game Synchronization
`gameSync.js` handles real-time coordination between multiple parent cameras including synchronized recording start/stop.
